# Data Storage

A massive part of any game, operating system, or software in general, is the ability to store data and thats exactly what these blocks do.

## Setting Your Storage Key

When you set a storage key, the user will be prompted to allow you to access that storage key, this is to give the user more choice on whether to allow a program to access a specific part of their account.

After you have set your storage key, you cannot change it until the user reboots.

## Getting and Setting Values

Getting a value from your storage will be very fast and not require any networking, however, updating a key will require the user to be online in order for the extension to properly request the key update to the rotur server.

Setting your id, settings key and deleting keys are the only blocks that will require networking
