### What is the format for a username?

\[designation]-\[username]

Example:

if you logged into originOS with the username Mist you might end up with the connection id of:

```
ori-MistÂ§afRs36sew
```

This is because the rotur username system gives each client a unique string after their name, so that multiple logins of the same user can all be handled individually. Rotur will handle this for you. to send a message to someone, get all clients on that username and to get the oldest (the standard for who to message) get the first item in the array.
