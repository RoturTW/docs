# Rotur Designations

## What?

Rotur designations are a small 3 letter string at the start of a username that is required for any Rotur client to communicate with you. These designations help in categorising and distinguishing among various operating systems within the Rotur ecosystem.

## Why?

So that clients can tell from the username what system a user is using.

## Propose Yours

Just put in a github issue to say to add it and ill put it below, please dont use a designation that already exists as it could break things.
