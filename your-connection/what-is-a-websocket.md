# What is a websocket?

A websocket is essentially just a way to send messages back and forth between two computers. Don't stress too hard about it. Imagine it just like texting a friend!

A simpler analogy might be comparing WebSockets to a phone call, where both parties can speak and listen simultaneously, allowing seamless, real-time communication. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are like sending letters through the mail, WebSockets keep the connection open, making it ideal for applications requiring continuous data exchange like online games, chat apps, or live financial feeds.
