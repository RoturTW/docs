### Who is Rotur for?

Rotur is aimed at Turbowarp-based operating systems but can be used in other environments as long as websockets are available.

The standard should allow for things like cross-play of games between operating systems, or collaborative editing on text editors, running on completely different projects!

We think this could be really really cool if its implemented thoroughly at a wide scale, and it is currently Present in 5 Systems (2 Released)

### Why use Rotur?

Rotur enables a whole range of new possibilities, simulated ports, client info, timestamps and more.
